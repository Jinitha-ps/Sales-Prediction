# Sales-Prediction
**About the Project: Sales Prediction** ðŸ“ˆ
This project is a machine learning regression analysis focused on predicting the total sales achieved by a business. The core objective is to understand the quantitative relationship between advertising expenditure across various channels and the resulting sales figures.

**Key Objective**
Predict Total Sales: Develop a model to forecast Sales based on investments in different advertising mediums.

Determine Feature Impact: Analyze how advertising spends on TV, Radio, and Newspaper individually affect the final total sales.

Dataset and Methodology
The project utilizes a dataset containing 200 entries and four attributes: money spent on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisements, with Sales as the target variable. The methodology includes:

Data Preprocessing: Initial steps involve loading the data and checking for missing values, confirming all columns are of the float64 type and are non-null.

Model Implementation: The analysis leverages a Random Forest Regressor to model the relationship between the advertising features and total sales.

Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the R2_score.

This project serves as an effective demonstration of applying linear regression and Random Forest techniques to solve a real-world business forecasting problem.
